      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We are a group of passionate students that seeks to share our experiences in competition math. Minnesota is still a relatively under-resourced state in competitive math education, having significantly less participation in state and national competitions. We hope to inspire more students to excel at competition math and help others along the way. </p>
