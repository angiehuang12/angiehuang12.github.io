        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          We are a group of passionate students that seeks to share our experiences in competition math. Minnesota is still a relatively under-resourced state in competitive math education, having significantly less participation in state and national competitions. Gaining experience in competition math is a great way to open the door to future STEM career paths. We hope to inspire more students to excel at competition math and make new connections along the way.
