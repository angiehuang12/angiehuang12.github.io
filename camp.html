      <h1>MNYMO Camp</h1>
      <p>Over 120 students joined us for our online camp from August 12th to 27th! Students chose between two class groups based on their familiarity with concepts. Students learned concepts from the four main subject areas of competition math (Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry), each of which was covered with one lesson on fundamentals and two lessons on advanced topics (inequalities and complex numbers for Algebra, perspectives and recursion for Combinatorics, theorems and tricks for Number Theory, and mass points and trigonometry for Geometry). We had so much fun with group problem solving sessions and activities!</p>

      <h2>Camp Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Looking for a dynamic summer experience to improve your competition math skills? Join Minnesota Youth Math Outreach for our free online camp! Led by members of the Minnesota All-State Math Team (including this year’s captains!), you’ll dive deep into Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry. Each topic gets three days of hands-on lessons, starting with core concepts and moving into advanced problem-solving techniques like Vieta’s formulas, multiplicative order, the Chinese remainder theorem, recursion, Diophantine equations, and mass points. All students are welcome—middle schoolers in particular will find this a great way to build confidence before high-school competitions! We can’t wait to see you there!

          <p style="width:50%; display:flex; justify-content: center"> Overall, I think that the MNYMO was a fun camp, and I would definitely do it again. You learn about things that you've already heard of, but you also learn new topics that challenge you a little bit. It's great for anyone who loves to do math and might consider having a future in STEM when they get older. Everyone was nice, helpful, and funny. It was definitely an experience to remember. <br> — Lexus Van Westen, 9th grade</p>

          <p style="width:50%; display:flex; justify-content: center"> MNYMO was very helpful and especially useful in covering topics if you’re considering taking the AMC 10 or other competitions. Additionally I thought the camp was very fun especially since I often get distracted in other classes, I really enjoyed this one. Even topics that they covered as review I found helpful because it can be hard to find good resources that help you practice certain topics.

          <p style="width:50%; display:flex; justify-content: center"> MNYMO was an awesome summer camp for people who enjoy mathematics. It was wonderful to make friends and communicate amongst them. We were taught about algebra, combinatorics, number theory and geometry. The teachers were great and they supported me a lot when I needed it. It was a great experience.

          <p style="width:50%; display:flex; justify-content: center"> MNYMO was one of the best math resources I have ever seen. We were taught algebra, combinatorics, number theory, geometry, and many other incredibly useful ideas. This camp is very fun, the instructors are very nice and funny. This camp was perfect at teaching competition math, this camp has allowed me to strive in competition math, for example, I have qualified for the 2025 MATHCOUNTS National Competition because of this camp. The instructors have supported me a lot. This camp is an experience I won’t forget.

          <p style="width:50%; display:flex; justify-content: center"> In my opinion MNYMO was an amazing camp for anyone interested in math. I thought it was very fun to challenge myself and learn something I wasn't taught in school. MNYMO taught us the 4 main aspects of competition math, the tricks and theorems for number theory were especially helpful. I really enjoyed the camp, the teachers were great, and I will take this camp again.
